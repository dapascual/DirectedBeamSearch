On Wednesday, Egypt's Supreme Military Council issued a declaration which will temporarily replace the country's former constitution, dating back to 1971. The declaration is based on amendments to the old constitution which were backed by the majority of people at a referendum on March 19. The amendments mostly concern procedures for presidential and parliamentary elections, and the terms of presidency. The old constitution was abrogated by the country's military on February 13, soon after President Mubarak's resignation. Parliamentary elections in Egypt are planned for this September.

We tend to think of Seattle in stereotypical ways: earthy, mellow, panoramic, rainy. But it's not all Patagonia and lattes out there, as the news yesterday about the Justice Department's investigation of Seattle police would indicate. The DOJ is looking into a possible pattern of the SPD using excessive force and discriminating against minorities, Justice announced here yesterday. At issue in the federal investigation are several high-profile incidents involving police violence. Last April, a detective was videotaped kicking a Latino robbery suspect and stating that he would beat the "Mexican piss" out of the suspect; In June, an officer was videotaped punching a 17-year-old African American girl who protested the arrest of a friend for jaywalking; and, In August, police shot a Native American woodcarver after he faied to drop his carving knife. Seattle Police Chief John Diaz told the Seattle Times that he welcomes the DOJ investigation and considers it like a "free audit." "We have nothing to hide," he said. "We've been open and transparent with the Department of Justice, which makes for a good working relationship."
